What is Zfone?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Zfone is my new secure VoIP phone software, which lets you make secure phone
calls over the Internet. In the future, the ZRTP protocol used by Zfone will be
integrated into standalone secure VoIP clients, but today we have a software
product that lets you turn your existing VoIP client into a secure phone. The
current Zfone software runs in the Internet Protocol stack on any Windows XP,Mac
OS X, or Linux PC, and intercepts and filters all the VoIP packets as they go in
and out of the machine, and secures the call on the fly. You can use a variety
of different software VoIP clients to make a VoIP call. The Zfone software
detects when the call starts, and initiates a cryptographic key agreement
between the two parties, and then proceeds to encrypt and decrypt the voice
packets on the fly. It has its own little separate GUI, telling the user if the
call is secure. It's as if Zfone were a "bump on the cord", sitting between the
VoIP client and the Internet. Think of it as a software bump-on-the-cord. Maybe
a bump in the protocol stack. To find general information about Zfone, visit the
Zfone home page. To learn about the right way to install and test Zfone, visit
the Getting Started with Zfone page. There's no online HELP with the Zfone beta
software, so be sure to read that page to get instructions on installing it and
running it. Reporting Bugs in the Zfone Public Beta

Please help us make Zfone better by reporting bugs. The email address for 
reporting bugs appears below, but first you should know about the known bugs and
other issues.

Don't blame Zfone for your VoIP client problems

Experience has shown that there
are many things that can go wrong with VoIP client
software. There could be problems with your firewall, with getting VoIP calls to
traverse your local network's NAT perimeter, with your audio configuration 
choices (especially your microphone), with your VoIP service provider. For this
reason, it is important that you get your VoIP client tested and working before
you install Zfone. We don't want to get emails from you complaining that Zfone
doesn't work, when you haven't first established that your VoIP client works in
your local network environment.


Default Installation pathes
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Main files:
daemon:  		/usr/local/bin/zfoned
control GUI at:	/usr/local/bin/zfone
zfone log file:	/var/log/zfone.log
secret cache:	/usr/local/share/zfone/zfone_cache.dat
ZID file:		/usr/local/share/zfone/zfone_zid.dat

Resources:
zfone sounds: 	/usr/local/share/zfone/sounds/
zfone pictures: /usr/local/share/zfone/pictures/


Usage
--------------------------------------------------------------------
	Zfone consist of two parts: daemon and control GUI. Daemon implement ZRTP
protocol and intergated to the Linux IP stack. Zfoned is the standart  network
daemon and can be used as other Linux daemons. Control GUI - interface between
userts and protocol logic. For using Zfone you mast ran zfoned (daemon) and
zfone (GUI). To ran zfoned you mast have root
privilages: 		"/usr/local/bin/zfoned".
To ran GUI type: 	"/usr/local/bin/zfone".


Known "Issues"
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Most of the trouble we have with this implementation of Zfone stems from the 
complexity of detecting the VoIP client's SIP and RTP packets on the fly,
figuring out what port numbers they use, and triggering ZRTP protocol whenever
these packets are detected. All of that class of problems would disappear if the
ZRTP protocol were integrated inside a VoIP client. The packet detection
problems only arise because we implement the ZRTP protocol in this particular
product outside the VoIP client as a "bump in the cord". 


Here are the known issues in this beta version: 

Sometimes one party cannot hear the other party. Sound flows in only one 
direction. We don't know if it's a Zfone problem, or the VoIP clients having
problems with NAT barriers. If you encounter this behavior, please file a bug
report and send us the Zfone log files (see below for how to do that). 

There are some cases where a VoIP client does not follow normal SIP and RTP 
protocols, and our Zfone proxy won't work in those cases. For example, if the
VoIP client sends the RTP packets through TCP/IP instead of UDP. Or if
it sends the SIP packet through a TLS tunnel. Or some even send the voice
packets through a TLS tunnel, I have heard. This makes it hard for us to see the
packets, so we can't trigger the ZRTP protocol. Again, all these
problems go away if the ZRTP protocol is integrated inside a VoIP client. We
have occasionally observed problems with Gizmo violating the normal protocols
this way, if it's talking to another Gizmo user. But only under certain
circumstances, such as when it has trouble with certain local network NAT
barriers. 


We'll add more as we get more bug reports from users. I predict that most of 
the problems will be related to trying to run the ZRTP protocol as a proxy in
the IP stack. 

For the free public beta of Zfone, bug reports are encouraged, but requests for 
support will likely get no response. If you want support, you'll have to wait
for the official release and pay for it. 

REPORTING BUGS
--------------------------------------------------------------------

We need your help in finding bugs, which is why we do a public beta release. 
Please do your part to help us make Zfone better for everyone by taking the time
to report bugs, and give us as much detail you can to help us track
down the problem and fix it (see below on what to include in the bug report).
Report bugs to my development team,
at bug-reports at philzimmermann dot com. Note that philzimmermann is spelled 
with 2 Ns. 

Please use the bug-reports email address only to report bugs or problems you are
having with the software, because it goes to the developers who fix bugs. If you
just want to send email to me for other reasons, use prz at mit dot edu. 

Be sure to specify everything in the bug report, such as: 
* the version and build number of Zfone you tested,
* the operating system you are using,
* what VoIP client (and version number of the VoIP client) you were using,
  the exact circumstances of the bug, and whether and how the bug can be 
  reproduced, whatever you can tell us about your NAT/Firewall environment (such
  as the type of router you are using, if you know anything about this),
  and, anything else that we should know.
* Also, Zfone writes a lot of diagnostic information to an error log. On the Mac
  and Linux, this log files are in /var/log/zfone_XXX.log, and on Windows, it's
  in /Zfone install directory/Zfone/Zfonelog. It would be helpful if
  you attached that file with your bug report, and get the other party in the
  phone call to attach his as well, with an introductory note explaining that
  the two log files are related. These log files are highly compressible,
  so if it's a large file, you might compress it into a .zip archive before
  emailing it. Mac OS X users can conveniently view the Zfone log file by
  running the Console utility (in the /Applications/Utilities folder). In the
  console tool bar select Logs, and open /var/log/zfone.log.
  Then copy this file to the clipboard and add it to the emailed bug report.

Advanced Users:

If you're a techno weenie with a lot of experience with the minutiae of your 
operating system, you can be even more helpful if you provide us with additional
details to diagnose the problem. Here's how. 

* On Windows, capture the information about network interfaces, by doing this:
  - Click Start - Run - cmd 
  -Then in the console: ipconfig 
  - Then use the mouse to right-click and in pop-ip menu selesc "select" item 
	and  copy the relevant text to the clipboard, then paste the information
	into the body of the emailed bug report. 

* On Linux or Mac OS X, capture the information about network interfaces. Open 
	a terminal window, type "ifconfig",
  	and copy the output into the body of the emailed bug report. 

* 	For Mac OS X, you may add zfone.crash.log. To do that, run the Console
	utility (in the /Applications/Utilities folder). In the console tool bar
	select Logs, and open ~/Library/Logs/CrashReporter/zfone.crash.log. Then
	copy this file to the clipboard and add it to the emailed bug report. 

*	For Linux, if the program crashes you should send us a backtrace of the
	program. If you are familiar with the gdb debugger, start up a terminal
	window and do these steps:
  	- ./gdb "path to zfoned" "path to core_file"
  	- Then, in gdb, type "info threads" - get the list of threads 
  	- For the transfer to the next thread: "thread N" (N is the thread number) 
  	- To print the backtrace: type "bt" 
  	- To exit from the debugger: type "quit"
